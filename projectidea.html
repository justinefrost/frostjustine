<h1 style="color:LightSeaGreen; text-align:center; font-family:Tahoma"> PROJECT IDEA</h1>
<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> My project idea is something that can motivate individuals and assist them with reducing their weekly wastage in relation to perishable foods/packaging. it also allows users to be getting more out of their weekly spending, if their grocery shop is on a budget, they would be getting their money’s worth.</p>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;">The younger generations (Z and Millennials) have been greatly exposed to the discussion about the environment and what we can do to minimalize our own impact. As a young adult, myself and many of my peers, prove to show qualities of conservation and want for change. Whether it be, changing lifestyle habits and food consumption habits, or only purchasing necessity items that are sustainably made (i.e. Vegan friendly / cruelty free).
I most definitely find myself displaying these behaviours and paying a lot more attention to wastage when it comes to food and rubbish. Food wastage is a very big issue. As Australians (and other 1st world countries) we have the luxury of ridiculous amounts of food sources and means in which we can obtain them. But as a result of this, our rubbish and food waste numbers are skyrocketing every year.</p>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Households hold the biggest percentage of contribution (34%). According to the Australian Food Bank, each year in Victoria alone, households throw away 250,000 tonnes of food. Across Australia, the stats show that it is roughly 2.5million tonnes of edible food gets thrown out annually. The more that each household is wasting, the more rot that occurs in landfill. Rotting food produces the greenhouse gas methane. Methane is 21x more dangerous than its friend, carbon dioxide. (Food Bank n.d.) </p>


<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Ideally, the program I have in mind would give the user the ability to input their weekly grocery list, the extent of the input is up to them. If they only want assistance on reducing food scraps, then they can enter accordingly. If the user chooses to enter packaged food for material waste purposes, then that option is available too. <p/>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Leaving out the initial use of the products, the program could: <br>
<ul>
<li> Suggest ways and/or find recipes for using the extent of the product. For example, one week the user buys a bunch of beets, has something already in <br> mind that they want to use the root of the beet for, it will then offer suggestions on what they can do with the remainder of the leaves. </li>


<li  style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Alternatively, give the user suggestions/recipes to use all items in one cohesive way based on what they have at the end of the week. You can enter the amounts from your list, and in return you a get list of suggestions, whether it be a soup/stew recipe, or even a just a small snack. There for, this feature allows you to get as much as you can out of your products, reducing your food wastage for that week. There will be times when there will be nothing for the program to offer suggestions, say if the user bought some rhubarb, only the stalks are edible. </li>

 <li style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> For non-perishable items (or ones with a little bit of a longer life span), that are unopened or barely used, the user can be connected with local food drives and charities where these products can be donated and used elsewhere.
 </li>

 <li style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> The other side to the program allows the user to input food products along with the type of packaging that they come in. Whether it be tins/cans, boxes, resealable bags etc. the user should be also able to input the size or weight that the packaging can hold. In return, a few options will be available. Similar to before, recipes and tips on what you can do with leftovers of those products in combination with others you may have left from that week, with the inclusion of:</li>


 <li style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Local reuse and repurpose where the user can take said items to someone or somewhere that is in need of the items that they possess.
Fun story – growing up my dad LOVED to do this, one of his big projects was his attempt in making a solar panel shell out of soda cans and similar tin type materials, For no other reason than a weekend hobby. He also made a radio out of a dishwashing detergent bottle. </li>

 <li style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> DIYs: giving the user ideas and small ‘how to’ procedures for repurpose of these items. I think people would be surprised with how many packages can be reused for cute DIYs. </li>

 <li style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Link the user to ‘Sustainable Victoria’ and get tips on how the materials are to be disposed of properly and where the materials can certain materials can be taken If the product they are wanting to recycle cannot be done so through council rubbish pickup. (Sustainable Victoria, n.d.). </li>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;">
The software required for this program will hold an index with these ideas/recipes and resources. Although it would likely be more efficient for the app to scan the web, based on key/trigger words. Then the results that are associated with those terms would be returned. A devices camera would be necessary, so instead of taking the time to input all products, where items have a barcode, that could be scanned, and the information would be readily available. This could also be used with fresh produce and all that would be needed to input would be the quantity (if known – but usually you can grasp a pretty good rough measurement based on the price per kg). This function could also be programmed to identify indicators of the lifespan. So, say if you scanned an avocado, depending on the colour gradient received from the photo, it would give you an estimated time of use before the avocado spoils and has to be thrown out. The scanning feature would also provide the details of the packaging material, for example, if the user were to scan a cling wrap/foil box, it would output information on breaking down this material for proper disposal (I embarrassingly only found out a month ago that the metal serrated strip on these boxes need to be taken off for cardboard to be recycled.. oops).</p>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;">Development would be purely based on the programming that is written and testing would be required to test the compatibility with the average person’s smart phone device, so this application would be accessible to a large number of the population. Whether you shop on a budget or not I think it could be quite useful for multiple financial demographics. </p>
