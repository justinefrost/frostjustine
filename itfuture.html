(or one of the top few) at this point in time would have to be one that specialises in security systems.
The job on Seek that I found was for an IT Security and Support Specialist. The position entails 3 major roles: </p>

<img src="seek.jpeg" style="width:300px;height:400px;">

<h3> Establish and maintain cyber security frameworks:</h3>
<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> This would mean I would be putting in place a plan to effectively identify and respond to problems and breaches within the systems, assessing potential risks and strengthening the frameworks in place to minimize these incidents from occurring. It would also mean monitoring and reviewing new security systems and their likeliness to work with existing policies. (Seek.com.au, 2020)</p>

<h3> Reporting:</h3>
<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;">Producing reports and communicating with the big boys and gals of the company to ensure that they are aware and understand the protocols and developments that are put in place, to store, reinforce confidence and comfort in their business’ security systems. (Seek.com.au, 2020)</p>

<h3> ICT support:</h3>
<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> Besides the obvious of lending a hand to employees in struggle street when they can’t get Microsoft word to work, this role would also mean setting up, updating and maintaining business devices i.e. employee phones, computers etc and ensuring that everything is up and running smoothly, while being regularly updated.
All of the above sounds really really cool to me, security has always been something that I thought was so interesting, I think the abundance of knowledge and skill that comes with it is inspiring (and honestly, just suuuuper cool), and moving forward, web security will be (and already is) a very big deal. This role shows variety in your every-day work life which would keep me motivated to put in the continuous effort.  (Seek.com.au, 2020)</p>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> To obtain this position, I would have to be certified in a fair few different things. I would need qualifications in Security Information and Event Management (SEIM) Plus, Microsoft Azure/365 security admin., Firewall and various ICT frameworks. All of these qualifications would not really mean much without holding adequate experience in this field and the confidence to showcase my abilities/certifications.
It would also mean that my ability to work in a team must be up to scratch, as communication with fellow colleagues and ones of higher status is crucial. Having the knack of communicating details that can be somewhat very confusing at times in simple and easily understanding ways would be super, as tech talk can be very intense and a lot to take in at times for people who may not be as familiar with the terms and concepts. (Seek.com.au, 2020)</p>

 <p style="color:LightSlateGrey;"> My way to get to my ideal position, would initially see me through the Bachelor of IT, with a master’s degree in cyber security, or maybe even a graduate cert. Although I believe for this type of position, and field of work, the more experience and knowledge you have would be ideal. After completing my degrees, I would have to become certified in the mandatory qualifications listed. Not even for this position alone, I think that they would be good sets of training to undergo and have on my CV. (RMIT, 2020)</p>

<p style="color:LightSlateGrey;">I do not hold these qualifications nor the master’s degree, but once I complete my bachelor’s degree, I’ll be on the right track. Although, I do think I already have quite strong communication skills and I can be quite assertive, which in a place of employment, it is an important quality to have. In saying that, with the training I would undergo, these skills would absolutely be built on. </p>
