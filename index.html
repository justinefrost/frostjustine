<h1 style="color:DarkOrange;">My Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:Orange;">The personal bits</h2>
<p> I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my parents are from different parts of the world, but it is definitely an interesting mix.
   My mum and her family being from Syria who migrated here back in the 60s. Whereas my dad and his family are from the United States, which they still live.
   Due to this, I fortunately hold dual citizenship of both Australia and the USA, which has become very convenient for me traveling back and forth over the years.
I was always an artistic child which always makes people question why I’m studying what I am!
Over the past few years I’ve found myself a creative outlet in ceramics, and it has become a huge love of mine.
I took classes for about a year and then it became something I always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty.
It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off.
