<h1 style="color:DarkOrange;">My Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:Orange;">The personal bits</h2>
<p> I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my parents are from different parts of the world, but it is definitely an interesting mix.
 My mum and her family being from Syria who migrated here back in the 60s. Whereas my dad and his family are from the United States, which they still live.
Due to this, I fortunately hold dual citizenship of both Australia and the USA, which has become very convenient for me traveling back and forth over the years.
I was always an artistic child which always makes people question why I’m studying what I am!
Over the past few years I’ve found myself a creative outlet in ceramics, and it has become a huge love of mine.
I took classes for about a year and then it became something I always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty.
It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off.

<h3 style="color:Orange;">IT to me</h3>
<p>My interest in IT has stemmed from when I was a young gal. My dad actually introduced me to it all so it’s been something that has been around for as long as I could remember. In his spare time, or when we hung out together on weekends, he was always showing me some program that he had been making (he wrote one that allowed him to play chess against a computer, because the pre-existing one on windows just wasn’t good enough!) or the latest computer he was building. I have very fond memories of always tripping over computer shells and stacks of motherboards and disk drives. I also always loved going into work with him on my school holidays, He worked at the head building of the National Australia Bank in the IT department and was part of the team that developed the initial idea for online banking, so going in and meeting all his work colleagues was always super fun and interesting!

I chose to study at RMIT mainly for the good reputation that I know the school holds, as well as the feedback I received from people I know that previously/currently study there. Whether I chose on campus study or online, it was going to be super convenient for me. Online study through RMIT has given me so much flexibility with my job, I work gross early mornings (6am roughly) until mid afternoon (3pm), which allows me to fit in my study time and ‘me’ time. I have been working since I was legally allowed at 15 years old and so giving up the income that I was used to was a big thing for me to do because I was so comfortable, and now my studies have allowed me to not have to.

I’m hoping from my studies to have a somewhat better understanding of the IT industry, although keeping in mind I guess no one ever will considering its always progressing and growing. I’m also hoping that I will narrow down my interest fields and become a little bit surer in which direction that I want to take it. Everything is very inspiring to me at the moment and I want to take on everything, but I think in the future that will make things hard to put myself in a long term career because I won’t be able to make my mind up (but I guess it’s a big enough industry where I can change with it!).

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50103010?type=standard#searchRequestToken=b3fe1989-6924-48a6-ab16-c89c467b12b6">My ideal job<a/>
<p>(or one of the top few) at this point in time would have to be one that specialises in security systems.
The job on Seek that I found was for an IT Security and Support Specialist. The position entails 3 major roles:

-	Establish and maintain cyber security frameworks:
This would mean I would be putting in place a plan to effectively identify and respond to problems and breaches within the systems, assessing potential risks and strengthening the frameworks in place to minimize these incidents from occurring. It would also mean monitoring and reviewing new security systems and their likeliness to work with existing policies. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

-	Reporting:

Producing reports and communicating with the big boys and gals of the company to ensure that they are aware and understand the protocols and developments that are put in place, to store, reinforce confidence and comfort in their business’ security systems. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

-	ICT support:

Besides the obvious of lending a hand to employees in struggle street when they can’t get Microsoft word to work, this role would also mean setting up, updating and maintaining business devices i.e. employee phones, computers etc and ensuring that everything is up and running smoothly, while being regularly updated.
All of the above sounds really really cool to me, security has always been something that I thought was so interesting, I think the abundance of knowledge and skill that comes with it is inspiring (and honestly, just suuuuper cool), and moving forward, web security will be (and already is) a very big deal. This role shows variety in your every-day work life which would keep me motivated to put in the continuous effort.  (Seek.com.au, 2020)

To obtain this position, I would have to be certified in a fair few different things. I would need qualifications in Security Information and Event Management (SEIM) Plus, Microsoft Azure/365 security admin., Firewall and various ICT frameworks. All of these qualifications would not really mean much without holding adequate experience in this field and the confidence to showcase my abilities/certifications.
It would also mean that my ability to work in a team must be up to scratch, as communication with fellow colleagues and ones of higher status is crucial. Having the knack of communicating details that can be somewhat very confusing at times in simple and easily understanding ways would be super, as tech talk can be very intense and a lot to take in at times for people who may not be as familiar with the terms and concepts. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

My way to get to my ideal position, would initially see me through the Bachelor of IT, with a master’s degree in cyber security, or maybe even a graduate cert. Although I believe for this type of position, and field of work, the more experience and knowledge you have would be ideal. After completing my degrees, I would have to become certified in the mandatory qualifications listed. Not even for this position alone, I think that they would be good sets of training to undergo and have on my CV. (RMIT, 2020)
I do not hold these qualifications nor the master’s degree, but once I complete my bachelor’s degree, I’ll be on the right track. Although, I do think I already have quite strong communication skills and I can be quite assertive, which in a place of employment, it is an important quality to have. In saying that, with the training I would undergo, these skills would absolutely be built on.
