<h1 style="color:DarkOrange;">My Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:Orange;">The personal bits</h2>
<p> I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my parents are from different parts of the world, but it is definitely an interesting mix.
 My mum and her family being from Syria who migrated here back in the 60s. Whereas my dad and his family are from the United States, which they still live.
Due to this, I fortunately hold dual citizenship of both Australia and the USA, which has become very convenient for me traveling back and forth over the years.
I was always an artistic child which always makes people question why I’m studying what I am!
Over the past few years I’ve found myself a creative outlet in ceramics, and it has become a huge love of mine.
I took classes for about a year and then it became something I always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty.
It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off.
</p>

<h3 style="color:Orange;">IT to me</h3>
<p>My interest in IT has stemmed from when I was a young gal. My dad actually introduced me to it all so it’s been something that has been around for as long as I could remember. In his spare time, or when we hung out together on weekends, he was always showing me some program that he had been making (he wrote one that allowed him to play chess against a computer, because the pre-existing one on windows just wasn’t good enough!) or the latest computer he was building. I have very fond memories of always tripping over computer shells and stacks of motherboards and disk drives. I also always loved going into work with him on my school holidays, He worked at the head building of the National Australia Bank in the IT department and was part of the team that developed the initial idea for online banking, so going in and meeting all his work colleagues was always super fun and interesting!</P>


<P> I chose to study at RMIT mainly for the good reputation that I know the school holds, as well as the feedback I received from people I know that previously/currently study there. Whether I chose on campus study or online, it was going to be super convenient for me. Online study through RMIT has given me so much flexibility with my job, I work gross early mornings (6am roughly) until mid afternoon (3pm), which allows me to fit in my study time and ‘me’ time. I have been working since I was legally allowed at 15 years old and so giving up the income that I was used to was a big thing for me to do because I was so comfortable, and now my studies have allowed me to not have to.
<P/>



<P> I’m hoping from my studies to have a somewhat better understanding of the IT industry, although keeping in mind I guess no one ever will considering its always progressing and growing. I’m also hoping that I will narrow down my interest fields and become a little bit surer in which direction that I want to take it. Everything is very inspiring to me at the moment and I want to take on everything, but I think in the future that will make things hard to put myself in a long term career because I won’t be able to make my mind up (but I guess it’s a big enough industry where I can change with it!).

<h4 style="color:Orange;">It future</h4>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50103010?type=standard#searchRequestToken=b3fe1989-6924-48a6-ab16-c89c467b12b6">My ideal job<a/>
<p>(or one of the top few) at this point in time would have to be one that specialises in security systems.
The job on Seek that I found was for an IT Security and Support Specialist. The position entails 3 major roles:

-	Establish and maintain cyber security frameworks:
This would mean I would be putting in place a plan to effectively identify and respond to problems and breaches within the systems, assessing potential risks and strengthening the frameworks in place to minimize these incidents from occurring. It would also mean monitoring and reviewing new security systems and their likeliness to work with existing policies. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

-	Reporting:

Producing reports and communicating with the big boys and gals of the company to ensure that they are aware and understand the protocols and developments that are put in place, to store, reinforce confidence and comfort in their business’ security systems. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

-	ICT support:

Besides the obvious of lending a hand to employees in struggle street when they can’t get Microsoft word to work, this role would also mean setting up, updating and maintaining business devices i.e. employee phones, computers etc and ensuring that everything is up and running smoothly, while being regularly updated.
All of the above sounds really really cool to me, security has always been something that I thought was so interesting, I think the abundance of knowledge and skill that comes with it is inspiring (and honestly, just suuuuper cool), and moving forward, web security will be (and already is) a very big deal. This role shows variety in your every-day work life which would keep me motivated to put in the continuous effort.  (Seek.com.au, 2020)

To obtain this position, I would have to be certified in a fair few different things. I would need qualifications in Security Information and Event Management (SEIM) Plus, Microsoft Azure/365 security admin., Firewall and various ICT frameworks. All of these qualifications would not really mean much without holding adequate experience in this field and the confidence to showcase my abilities/certifications.
It would also mean that my ability to work in a team must be up to scratch, as communication with fellow colleagues and ones of higher status is crucial. Having the knack of communicating details that can be somewhat very confusing at times in simple and easily understanding ways would be super, as tech talk can be very intense and a lot to take in at times for people who may not be as familiar with the terms and concepts. (Seek.com.au, 2020)

My way to get to my ideal position, would initially see me through the Bachelor of IT, with a master’s degree in cyber security, or maybe even a graduate cert. Although I believe for this type of position, and field of work, the more experience and knowledge you have would be ideal. After completing my degrees, I would have to become certified in the mandatory qualifications listed. Not even for this position alone, I think that they would be good sets of training to undergo and have on my CV. (RMIT, 2020)
I do not hold these qualifications nor the master’s degree, but once I complete my bachelor’s degree, I’ll be on the right track. Although, I do think I already have quite strong communication skills and I can be quite assertive, which in a place of employment, it is an important quality to have. In saying that, with the training I would undergo, these skills would absolutely be built on.

<h5 style=" color:Orange">PERSONALITY TESTS AND RESULTS</h5>
<p> Myers Briggs – (MBTI)
According to the MBTI – Type test that I took, I am a ‘Protagonist’ (ENFJ–A/ENFJ-T) personality type. The results indicate that I am a charismatic, passionate natural born leader. I (supposedly) hold natural confidence with the intention to influence people for the better. I’m attracted to strong, personalities and am not afraid to speak up when necessary. Communication comes easily to me and I’m able to observe other personalities and respond/cater to them appropriately. I (definitely) tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, which can be both a negative and a positive. Negative in the sense that I could be blindsided.
The results also implied, that when working in a team/working environment, I hold the desire to cooperate well and assist when needed. I try to encourage everyone to feel comfortable enough in the group where everyone can express their suggestions and opinions freely so we can all work together to achieve the end goal.
When working with my team, I think these qualities will be well fitted. If I see direction not being taken, I will gladly take the reins and get my team on the right track. Being aware of these results, when working with my team, it’ll lead me to make a conscious effort to ensure that everyone’s ideas/concerns/suggestions are taken into account and how we can work with them.  (16personalities, ENFJ type n.d.)

VARK (VISIAL, AURAL, READ/WRITE, KINESTHETIC) Test –
According to this ‘learning styles test’ I am a visual/kinesthetics learner. I already knew this about myself, but it was very interesting to see the results presented to me. The results imply that I absorb more information when visual presentations/demonstrations are in front of me (diagrams, charts etc). On the other hand, I scored quite highly in kinesthetics, which is a hands-on approach. This means I am often very happy to work things out actively. An explanation can only get you so far, but I definitely think things really stick when I can apply what I’ve learnt.
These things will come in handy to me when communicating with my group, especially when it comes to sharing files for our project, or any of the visuals that come along with online learning. All different media types will be accessible for my teammates and I, so I’d imagine we will be all able to learn in our preferred ways. (VARK Questionnaire n.d.)

Big 5 Personality Test –
I scored quite highly (high range) in conscientiousness, which implies that I’m very conscientious, disciplined and efficient. I also like everything well organised with a great attention to detail. In a work environment this would be very beneficial for me and my team. Having these traits gives me the ability to carry my weight to the best of my ability, taking the burden off of my team and allowing them to focus on their end of the deal. In saying that, I am always happy to help if someone else’s role is proving to be more difficult.
Second highest score was agreeableness, followed by openness to experience, then extraversion and lastly natural reactions. All of my scores were actually in the mid – high range, besides natural reactions. Which I don’t necessarily agree with because I don’t believe that I am prone to worry and easily upset. (123Tests, Big 5 personality test report n.d.)

The higher scores in the other four categories are appropriate for working in a team, I would say. Preference in co-operation than conflict and competition is definitely ideal for we are all working together. Being assertive, outgoing and finding enjoyment in working with others is most definitely ideal as well. When navigating the team assignments, it’ll be important for me to have crew mates with the same attitudes and qualities. I think I will find it hard if not everyone is as driven to complete the task and do well, but I will be willing to encourage them and provide assistance if need be.

<h6 style= "color:Orange;"> PROJECT IDEA</h6>
<p>
My project idea is something that can motivate individuals and assist them with reducing their weekly wastage in relation to perishable foods/packaging. it also allows users to be getting more out of their weekly spending, if their grocery shop is on a budget, they would be getting their money’s worth.

The younger generations (Z and Millennials) have been greatly exposed to the discussion about the environment and what we can do to minimalize our own impact. As a young adult, myself and many of my peers, prove to show qualities of conservation and want for change. Whether it be, changing lifestyle habits and food consumption habits, or only purchasing necessity items that are sustainably made (i.e. Vegan friendly / cruelty free).
I most definitely find myself displaying these behaviours and paying a lot more attention to wastage when it comes to food and rubbish. Food wastage is a very big issue. As Australians (and other 1st world countries) we have the luxury of ridiculous amounts of food sources and means in which we can obtain them. But as a result of this, our rubbish and food waste numbers are skyrocketing every year.

Households hold the biggest percentage of contribution (34%). According to the Australian Food Bank, each year in Victoria alone, households throw away 250,000 tonnes of food. Across Australia, the stats show that it is roughly 2.5million tonnes of edible food gets thrown out annually. The more that each household is wasting, the more rot that occurs in landfill. Rotting food produces the greenhouse gas methane. Methane is 21x more dangerous than its friend, carbon dioxide. (Food Bank n.d.)


Ideally, the program I have in mind would give the user the ability to input their weekly grocery list, the extent of the input is up to them. If they only want assistance on reducing food scraps, then they can enter accordingly. If the user chooses to enter packaged food for material waste purposes, then that option is available too.
Leaving out the initial use of the products, the program could:
-	Suggest ways and/or find recipes for using the extent of the product. For example, one week the user buys a bunch of beets, has something already in mind that they want to use the root of the beet for, it will then offer suggestions on what they can do with the remainder of the leaves.

-	Alternatively, give the user suggestions/recipes to use all items in one cohesive way based on what they have at the end of the week. You can enter the amounts from your list, and in return you a get list of suggestions, whether it be a soup/stew recipe, or even a just a small snack. There for, this feature allows you to get as much as you can out of your products, reducing your food wastage for that week. There will be times when there will be nothing for the program to offer suggestions, say if the user bought some rhubarb, only the stalks are edible.
-	For non-perishable items (or ones with a little bit of a longer life span), that are unopened or barely used, the user can be connected with local food drives and charities where these products can be donated and used elsewhere.

The other side to the program allows the user to input food products along with the type of packaging that they come in. Whether it be tins/cans, boxes, resealable bags etc. the user should be also able to input the size or weight that the packaging can hold. In return, a few options will be available. Similar to before, recipes and tips on what you can do with leftovers of those products in combination with others you may have left from that week, with the inclusion of:


-	Local reuse and repurpose where the user can take said items to someone or somewhere that is in need of the items that they possess.
Fun story – growing up my dad LOVED to do this, one of his big projects was his attempt in making a solar panel shell out of soda cans and similar tin type materials, For no other reason than a weekend hobby. He also made a radio out of a dishwashing detergent bottle.

-	DIYs: giving the user ideas and small ‘how to’ procedures for repurpose of these items. I think people would be surprised with how many packages can be reused for cute DIYs.

-	Link the user to ‘Sustainable Victoria’ and get tips on how the materials are to be disposed of properly and where the materials can certain materials can be taken If the product they are wanting to recycle cannot be done so through council rubbish pickup. (Sustainable Victoria, n.d.)

The software required for this program will hold an index with these ideas/recipes and resources. Although it would likely be more efficient for the app to scan the web, based on key/trigger words. Then the results that are associated with those terms would be returned. A devices camera would be necessary, so instead of taking the time to input all products, where items have a barcode, that could be scanned, and the information would be readily available. This could also be used with fresh produce and all that would be needed to input would be the quantity (if known – but usually you can grasp a pretty good rough measurement based on the price per kg). This function could also be programmed to identify indicators of the lifespan. So, say if you scanned an avocado, depending on the colour gradient received from the photo, it would give you an estimated time of use before the avocado spoils and has to be thrown out. The scanning feature would also provide the details of the packaging material, for example, if the user were to scan a cling wrap/foil box, it would output information on breaking down this material for proper disposal (I embarrassingly only found out a month ago that the metal serrated strip on these boxes need to be taken off for cardboard to be recycled.. oops).

Development would be purely based on the programming that is written and testing would be required to test the compatibility with the average person’s smart phone device, so this application would be accessible to a large number of the population. Whether you shop on a budget or not I think it could be quite useful for multiple financial demographics.
