<h1 style="color:DarkOrange;">My Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:Orange;">The personal bits</h2>
<p> I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my parents are from different parts of the world, but it is definitely an interesting mix.
 My mum and her family being from Syria who migrated here back in the 60s. Whereas my dad and his family are from the United States, which they still live.
Due to this, I fortunately hold dual citizenship of both Australia and the USA, which has become very convenient for me traveling back and forth over the years.
I was always an artistic child which always makes people question why I’m studying what I am!
Over the past few years I’ve found myself a creative outlet in ceramics, and it has become a huge love of mine.
I took classes for about a year and then it became something I always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty.
It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off.

<h3 style="color:Orange;">IT to me</h3>
<p>My interest in IT has stemmed from when I was a young gal. My dad actually introduced me to it all so it’s been something that has been around for as long as I could remember. In his spare time, or when we hung out together on weekends, he was always showing me some program that he had been making (he wrote one that allowed him to play chess against a computer, because the pre-existing one on windows just wasn’t good enough!) or the latest computer he was building. I have very fond memories of always tripping over computer shells and stacks of motherboards and disk drives. I also always loved going into work with him on my school holidays, He worked at the head building of the National Australia Bank in the IT department and was part of the team that developed the initial idea for online banking, so going in and meeting all his work colleagues was always super fun and interesting!

I chose to study at RMIT mainly for the good reputation that I know the school holds, as well as the feedback I received from people I know that previously/currently study there. Whether I chose on campus study or online, it was going to be super convenient for me. Online study through RMIT has given me so much flexibility with my job, I work gross early mornings (6am roughly) until mid afternoon (3pm), which allows me to fit in my study time and ‘me’ time. I have been working since I was legally allowed at 15 years old and so giving up the income that I was used to was a big thing for me to do because I was so comfortable, and now my studies have allowed me to not have to.

I’m hoping from my studies to have a somewhat better understanding of the IT industry, although keeping in mind I guess no one ever will considering its always progressing and growing. I’m also hoping that I will narrow down my interest fields and become a little bit surer in which direction that I want to take it. Everything is very inspiring to me at the moment and I want to take on everything, but I think in the future that will make things hard to put myself in a long term career because I won’t be able to make my mind up (but I guess it’s a big enough industry where I can change with it!).
