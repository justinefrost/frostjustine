<h1 style="color:DarkOrange; text-align:center">My Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:Orange; text-align:center">THE PERSONAL BITS</h2>
<p> I am 22 and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. Both of my parents are from different parts of the world, but it is definitely an interesting mix.<br>
 My mum and her family being from Syria who migrated here back in the 60s. Whereas my dad and his family are from the United States, which they still live. <br>
Due to this, I fortunately hold dual citizenship of both Australia and the USA, which has become very convenient for me traveling back and forth over the years.
I was always an artistic child which always makes people question why I’m studying what I am! <br>
Over the past few years I’ve found myself a creative outlet in ceramics, and it has become a huge love of mine.
I took classes for about a year <br> and then it became something I always wanted to do, even when I was occupied at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about going home and getting my hands dirty.<br>
It is definitely the most satisfying ways to switch your mind off.
